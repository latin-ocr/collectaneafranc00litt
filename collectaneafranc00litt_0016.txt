4 ’ BROTHER WILLIAM OF ENGLAND,

no answer; but we will now proceed to show that Matthew
Paris was keenly interested in an artist among the early Fran-
ciscans.

Under the year 1227, Matthew Paris, after quoting, as
we have seen, Roger of Wendover's account of St. FranciS,
inserted in his Chronica Majom the Rule of the F riars Minor
as approved by Honorius III. in 1224. In the margin of the
manuscript (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, XVI„ fol. 67),
opposite the chapter De divino qfficio et jejunia, et quomodo ire
debeant per mundum, he gives a figure of a Minorite with
Frater Willelmus natione Anglicus socius Sancti Francisci in
rubric above (No. ΙΙΙ.). It cannot be regarded as a portrait,
the face being of a conventional type, but it gives a good idea
of the habit.

In the Liber Additamentorum or book of additions to the
Chronica Majora, now in the British Museum (MSI Cotton
Nero, DI), Matthew Paris again gives the Rule of the F riars
Minor (fol. 156), and the recto of the preceding leaf is occu-
pied by a full-length drawing, in pencil and partly in pen, of our
Lord, holding up the right hand in blessing and holding the
keys in the left; he is between the seven candles burning
(No. IV.).l One of the candles has been cut off by the
binder. The flames of the candles are red ; the pupils of the
eyes black ; the hair is light yellow, and the same yellow wash
is used to shade the folds of the garment. The leaf measures
14 >< 9 incheS, and has been reduced almost by half in Plate
IV. On one side of the head is the inscription: “Alpha et
ω viuens in secula seculorum '': on the other: “This is the
work of Brother William of the Order of Minors, the com-
panion of St. FranciS, second in that Order, holy in conversation,
English by birth ''. Near the bottom of the page: Brevis
descriptio Domini: Acta Severa, locutio sera, set ora serena.2

1Rev. I, 11-2o: the lines stretching from the face across the page represent

the ‘ sharp two-edged sword,’ Rev. I, 16.
Another inscription: “ Hec etiam mulier antea Marcella vocabatur, que

omnibus relictis sicut apostoli Christi in terra predicantis vestigia iugiter
sequebatur '⁷—refers to a note on the verso of the leaf. Across the candle-

stieks is an erased inscription in rubric.
