FORMERLY IN THE PHILLIPPS LIBRARY 13

III. (fols, 104-141). Aliqua exempla de vita b. Patris nostri
Franczlrci et sociorum ejus, Such is the general title of this
part which may be further subdivided.

(a) The first subdivision comprises Nos, 8 1-140. It is iden-

. tical‚ except for a few omissions with Nos, I.-LXVIII. of the

Liegnitz MS. and Nos, I.-LXIII. ofVatican MS. 4354.¹ It
begins with fifty Chapters of the Speculum Perfidiam, chosen‚ on
what principle does not appear, from Chapters Ι -97 of that work.
The order ofchapters is the same as in Sabatier's edition, and the
text often agrees with that of Vatican MS. 4 3 54 and the Spec-
ulum Vitae. Chapter 97 of the Speculum perfectiouis is followed
(fol. Ι 161), as in the Liegnitz and Vatican MSS„ by the seven
Chapters of the Legenda Vetus, as printed by Sabatier in the
Opuscules dc Critique H istorique‚ fasc, HL: these have no
separate general title in our MS.

(b) The next chapter (fol, 118V, No. 141 below) begins
with a larger initial than usual, which may—-but does not
necessarily—imply that the scribe is beginning a new series.
of extractS. It corresponds with a paragraph in the Historia
satyrica of Paulinus Puteolanus on the early friars, Next we
have a version of the revelation which St. Francis had de statu
et processu ordinis sui,

(c) This is succeeded by a chapter (No, 143) on the loss of
the second rule‚ beginning Dicebat euim frater Leo, which is
a variation on the usual introduction to the Speculum Per-
fectionz'S, as contained in the Mazarin MSS.‚‘2 but which occurs
in an Ashburnharn MS. at Florence.3

The next chapter (No. 144) is headed: “Concerning the
second tirne that he had the rule from the mouth of Christ in
the same form as before, because the first was lost by careless-
ness, in order that from this he might be likened to MoseS, ete.'’
The incipit is then given: “Cum b. Franciscus esset in eodem
monte '’ [etC.]‚ with the reference: “ Require residuum superius
primo capitu10.’'

It is clear then that we have here a new introduction to
