12 DESCRIPTION OF A FRANCISCAN MANUSCRIPT

which it is almost contemporary. It does not however contain
many of the characteristic errors of the Liege MS. It would
be rash to draw any inferences from the use of the form
catz'nelle in both MSS. (Actus 8, ἓ 16 = No, 65 below3 21, ἕ 12
= N 0. 24 below), or the substitution of fratribus for fructibus
(Λείας 28, g 29 = No, 19 below), or visceribus for viribus (Actus
54, ἕ 3 = No, 42 below). A mistake however which is
difficult to explain, except on the hypothesis of some ultimate
connexion between the two MSS, is magnam for horam (Actus
52, ἓ 24 = No, 50 below). And the Phillipps readings often
supply the explanations of the errors of the Liege scribe: thus
de secundo (Actus 39, ἓ 9, ε. = N 0. 30 below) is a misreading

of de sero: roborati . . . remisit (Actus 49, ἓ 19 = No, 36
below) is an unhappy compromise between the roboratos . . .
remisit of the Spa. Vitae and the roborati . . . remanserunt of

the Phillipps MS. ; while the curious accusative lactem of the
Liege MS. (Actus 54, ξ 26 = No, 42 below) is made more
intelligible by the lactenti, ίαείεαίες, of the Phillipps MS. In
spite of this distant relationship to the Liege MS„ the first
version of the Λείας in the Phillipps MS. belongs to a different
type from that of any of the known manuscripts The second
version (fols, 142-153) so far as can be judged from the few
chapters given in full,l approximates more closely to the printed
text, but may perhaps be found to form a connecting link
between the two types The question of th'e relation between
these two “states ” of the Λείας deserves a more detailed ex-
amination than I have been able to give in the present description.
Of the 76 chapters of the Actus the first version contains
all except Chapters 40, 44, 45, 47, 61-64, 66, 67, 70. Of
these, Chapters 67 and 40 occur in Part ΙΙΙ, of our ΜΞ.2
Chapters 44, 45 and 47 are given in full in Part IV. in the
second version of the Λείας.3 Consequently the only chapters
not included in the volume are 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 70. It is
doubtful whether these formed part of the original Λείας.

1 Namely Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 30, 31, 44, 45, 47 (the order is different in
our MS. version).
2 Nos. 94 and 199 below. 3 Nos. 214, 215, 216 below.
