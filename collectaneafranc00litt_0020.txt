8 BROTHER WILLIAM OF ENGLAND

Bartholomew of Pisa preserves another tradition, namely
that when John de Capella “left the Order‚ became a leper,
and through impatience hanged himself,'’ his place among the
twelve companions of St. Francis was taken by “the most
perfect brother William the Englishman ”.1

In a list of relies shown to the people in the church of
St. Francis (drawn up e. 1380> was ‘⁶ part of a bone ofWilliam
the Englishman ’'.2

Fortunatus Hueber gives as the date of Brother William's
death, 7th March, about the year 12 323

The thanks of the Society are due to the Master and
Fellows of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, for permission
to reproduce the miniatures of St. Francis and of Brother
William, and to the Keeper of the Manuscripts in the Eritish
Museurn for permission to reproduce the drawing of Christ.
Iwish also'to express rny obligations to Mr. Robert Steele
who first called my attention to these interesting drawingS.
