differs from the versionprinted in the Analecta Franczlrcana‚.
HL, in that the author, the confessor of Brother Roger, speaks-
throughout in the first person ; it probably takes us therefore
a stage further back than the printed version.1

The items noted in the following description are numbered
consecutively in the left-hand margin. In the right-hand mar-
gin references are given to the corresponding printed text.
“SpeC. Perf.” and “Actus '’ refer to the texts edited by
Sabatier: “Lemmens’' means the “Speculum Perfectioni5,''
edited by Father L. Lemmens in Documenta Antiqua Fran-
cz'scana, IL: “ Lemmens Intentio Regulae’' and “Verba S.
Francisci ’' refer to the two opuscules edited by F ather Lem-
mens among the “Scripta Fratris Leonis ” in Documem‘a
Antiqua Franci-ecana, I.

New chapterS, or versions differing essentially from the
printed version5‚ are printed in full. Variations from the
printed text which alter the ‘sense are noted ; and though no
attempt has been made to indicate more than a few of the
verbal differences, it is hoped that a sufficient number of these
is given to assist experts in determining the relation of this to
other similar manuscripts,

I desire to thank Monsieur Sabatier for many references
, and not a few corrections,
