As to the extent and arrangement of the Grey Friars
Library Ι am not able to form more than the vaguest con-
clusion from the extant remains. We see in one case (No. 7)
an indication that some at least of the books lay on sloping
deskS, in a position that was general in medieval times, We
see also that there were at least six “ classes '' in the library,
distinguished by the letters A to F (though of class A we have
no remains): and that in class Β there were as many as 46·
volumeS, and in E as many as 65. The remaining classes ran
to at least 15 in C, 17 in D, and 27 in E. This gives a
minimum of 170 volumes, It is perhaps not too much to as-
sume that there was an average of 50 books in each claSS,
which would give a total of 300. There is some probability
that they were arranged according to their main subjectS.
The two remaining volumes from class Β are both glossed
portions of the Bible. That from C, which is but a fragment,
of 24 leaves, contained a Canon Law treatise, and a tract of
Bede. The two from D are both historical: three from E are
two of them works of St. Gregory; the third is medieval
divinity. The nine from F, with one exception (No 12), con-
tain works of medieval date, but not all theological. At least
one work of considerable interest, it may be noted, has been
preserved to us in the Grey F riars copy—the Symbolum Elec-
torum of Giraldus, The letters of Gilbert Foliot, t00, are a
rarity, even if it be not the case that some of them exist only
in the Hereford manuscript.

Another point should be noted. There is nothing to
show (Ι think) that any of the extant books were written in
or for the Grey F riars : of several we have evidence that they
were bought or given. But in No, 5 there is an addition of
an interesting kind which we may safely regard as Franciscan :
Ι mean the scraps of transliterated Greek (and Hebrew) which
