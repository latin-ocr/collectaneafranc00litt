BROTHER WILLIAM OF ENGLAND‚ COMPANION
OF ST. FRANCIS, AND SOME FRANCISCAN
DRAWINGS IN THE MATTHEW PARIS MANU-
SCRIPTS.

IN 1236 Matthew Paris succeeded Roger of Wendover as
historian of the Abbey of St. Albans, In his Chronica Majom,
which first ended at 12 50 and was subsequently continued to
his death in 12 59, he incorporated much of the work of his
predecessor, making numerous additions and alterations as he
approached his own time: from 1235 it becomes entirely his
own work. The original fair copy of the Chronicle from 1 189
to 1 25 3 exists in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS. XVI.
This was executed under Matthew's personal supervision‚
mostly between 12 36 and 1250, and is probably partly in his
own hand. It contains many marginal drawingS, with some of
which we are now concerned.

Under the year 1227 Matthew Paris borrows the account
of St. Francis almost verbatim from Roger of Wendover. In
the margin of fol. 66 of the MS. he supplements this account
by two pen drawing5‚ which are reproduced in the original
size in this volume. The first (No. I.) represents St. Francis,
preaching to the birds and illustrates the following passage in
the text: “ And so departing from the city (of Rome) he found(
sitting in the suburb, on carrion, crOWS‚ kites and daw5‚ and.
many other birds flying in the air, and said to them: ‘ L.
command you in the name of Jesus Christ whom the Jews·
crucified, whose teaching the wretched Romans have despised‚
that you come to me and hear the word of God, in the name
of Him who created you and rescued you in Noah's Ark from
the waters of the flood.’ And forthwith at his command the

whole of that multitude of birds came thither and surrounded
