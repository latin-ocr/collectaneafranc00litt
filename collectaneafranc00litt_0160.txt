144 RECORDS OF THE FRANCISCAN

the later date. Do any of the names throw any light on the
question? The only friar mentioned that I have been able to
identify with certainty is Ralph de Medburne; he comes first
in a list of nineteen friars os Northampton presented by the
Provincial Minister to the Bishop for licence to hear confes-
sions in 1 300, but he was not one of the six actually licensed :1
on two occasions in Ι 300 the Keeper of the Wardrobe gave to
’ the F riars Minor of Northampton sums of money by the hand
of ‘⁶ Friar Ralph of Medburne '’.2 His death is more likely to
have taken place in 1304 than in 1334 3 but we may note that
Adam of Lincoln, Provincia] Minister in 1304, did not die till
Ι 333 (see below).

Another friar mentioned, Adam Lufdeford of Grimsby‚ is
probably identical with Adam de Ludeford, who was among
the friars licensed by Bishop Dalderby‚ in August, 1300, at
the instance, of the Custodian and Guardian of Lincoln, to
hear confessions in the county of Lincoln.3 If W. de Corf of
Winchelsea could be identified with William de Corfe of
Winchester,4 who was licensed to hear confessions in 1318
and 1322, the question would be settled in favour of the later
date3 but this is uncertain. More decisive evidence will no
doubt be forthcoming as Episcopal Registers become more
available. It might also help to settle the question if. we
could find a mention elsewhere of the Chapter of 13 343 but
so sar, I have not discovered one, and must confess myself
unable to solve the problem.

Before giving the documents I take this opportunity of
printing a list of Provincial Chapters of the Friars Minor in
England, so far as I have been able to find them, in the hopes
that it may serve as a nucleus for further additionS.
