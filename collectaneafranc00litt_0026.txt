14 DESCRIPTION OF A FRANCISCAN MANUSCRIPT

the Speculum Peffectz'omk, and a new title and a new incipit
to the first chapter. And if we examine the fifty—five chapters
which corne between this point and the group of testimonies
on the Indulgence of the Portiuncula‚ namely, Nos, 145-99
(fols 1 19-34), we shall find that twenty-six chapters and part
of three others represent chapters of the Speculum Peffectzbuzlf,
twelve correspond more or less exactly to chapters of II. Ce«
lano which are not found in the Speculum Peffectz'0n225‚ while
twelve form a group of Mz‘raculaff ¹

The chapters of the Speculum Peffectz‘om’s are numbered in

the following pages: Nos¹ 147-52‚ 153 (part 1), 156-58, 159
(part), 160, 161, 163-6, 168, 169, 184-6, 188, 189 <parts 1 and
3), 190, 192, 193, 196, 198. Nearly all these are found also
in the Intentio Reguloe‚ V erba S. Fraucz'scz' and Speculum Per-
fectz'om's of Lemmens. In these cases our MS. almost in-
variably reproduces 3 text approaching much more closely to
the Lemmens’ type than to the Sabatier÷type—with this very
important modification, that, where the Lemmens’ version only
gives an extract, our MS. gives the whole chapter. The
Lemmens' order of chapters is often preserved. We have
therefore in these chapters the original of the Lemmens'
version before it was edited and abbreviated, as F ather
Lemmens thinks by order of CrescentiUS‚ more probably by
some private compiler. For details I must refer to the
detailed description. .

The chapters corresponding to chapters of II. Celano
which are not contained in the Speculum Perfectz'om’s, are
Nos 153, part 2 (=21), 154 (=2o)‚ 155 (=162-3)‚ 162(=66)‚
167 (=49)‚ 179 (=72>‚ 187 (ΖΞ-2), 189, part 2 (=74)‚ 191
·(=130>‚ 194 ἔξω), 195 (=76>‚ 197 (=77)- The figures in
brackets refer to the chapters of II. CelanO, part ii. (ed. E.
d'Alencon). Of these No, 162 1(---66), on the visit of the
Bishop of Assisi to St. FranciS, has been printed by Father
Lemmens as cap. 4 of the “Legenda Vetus '’ (Doc. Antz'q.
Franc. ii. pp. 96-7).

These chapters differ in style and to some extent in sub-

1 Three chapters, 145, 146 and 180, do not fall into any of these groups.
