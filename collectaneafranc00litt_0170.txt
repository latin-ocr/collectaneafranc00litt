ADDENDUM To THE LIBRARY - OF THE GREY
FRIARs OF HEREFORD (p. 123).

Since my main notes* on the Grey Friars' Library at*
Hereford were put together, two more items have come ἐον
my knowledge‚—-just not too late to be recorded in this volume.
OtherS, fated to be too late, will doubtless emerge.

(1) The first, of which I owe the details to the kindness-
of ΜΓ. J. A. Herbert‚ consists of a note in the Cotton MS..
Vespasian A. ΧΙΙΙ, The second portion of this volume was
written in the first half of cent. XV. by “ ffrere Jon Mavns''
or “ Johannes Mavn5,’' whose name appears on ff. 114b, 118„
123, 13ob‚ 142.

The main contents of this portion are :—

The Historia of Pseudo-Turpin.
Miscellanea.
Apollonius of Tyre.

On f. 115b is the following important note: —

bone cum prolog0‚ lucas antiocensis. Fuit-
in diebus Herodi3‚ luc. 1⁰ ewangelium.
