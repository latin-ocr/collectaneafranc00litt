116 THE LIBRARY OF THE

VIII, to James Boyle‚1 an ancestor of the Earls of Cork and
Orrery.

Of the library no catalogue is known to exist,2 but about
a score of the books are identifiable in various collectionS.
They are usually inscribed with the name of the convent, and
always (except in one instance) with a press-mark consisting
of a letter of the alphabet and an Arabic numeral.

The letter may be taken, as in other cases, to have indi-
cated the desk or class to which the book was assigned ; the
numeral designated its place on the shelf.

The press-mark was one of those selected for reproduction
in Plate 17 of the New Paloeographz‘cal Socz‘ety.

It has seemed to me that the press-marks have mostly
been inserted by one and the same hand, in the books which
Ι have myself examined. They are large and bold. Ι should
suppose them to be of the late XI'Vth or early XVth century.

Eight of the volumes are preserved in the Library of the
Dean and Chapter of Hereford: three are in the British
Museum 3 three in the Bodleian: four at Cambridge. Iowe
thanks to ΜΓ. J P. Gilson and to Mr. Craster for help given
in connexion with the London and Oxford MSS„ and to Dr.
Hastings Rashdall for kindly facilitating my researches in the
Hereford Library. Ι do not suppose that the list I offer here
is complete, but it will serve as a beginning.

I enumerate the books in the order of their press-marks
