eleven of them. No attempt is made to arrange these names
according to custodies; but an analysis will show that thirteen
belong to the custody of Cambridge, eleven to that of Oxford,
nine to that of London, six to that of Bristol, while the
custodies of York, Worcester, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne are
represented by one each. At the bottom of the page is the
note: ‘⁶ 17 Dicta (Ρ) 2. Id. Aprilis* (12 April).

The second page (fol. 1¹³) is ‘written in another and less
tidy hand (B). The notes at the top and bottom of the page
are inscribed in yet another and smaller hand (C). The page
begins with the note: “Hoc anno fuit capitulum generale
apud Bononiam,’' no doubt the chapter of 22 May, 1328..
Then follow the names—forty-three in fact, but they are
numbered as forty-five‚ the first eight being counted as ten.
The convents are generally grouped according to custodieS,
and an analysis shows that Cambridge has eight nameS,
Oxford two, London eight, Eristol five, York seven, Worcester
seven, N ewcastle four, while two names cannot be assigned to
their custodies At the bottom of the page is the note:
⁴‘ N umber of friars deceased since the preceding general chapter
1248 '’. This will be the number of friars in the whole Order
who died between the chapter of Lyons 1325 and that of
Bologna 1328.

I suggest that the first page contains the list of English
friars who died and whose names were sent in to the Pro-
vincial Minister between 15 August, 1327, and 12 April, 1 328 ;
about the latter date, the Provincial Minister would be setting
out for the General Chapter. The second page would contain
the list of deceased friars whose names were sent in between
12 April and the date of the next⁸ Provincia] Chapter, probably
8 September, 1328.

The mortality is exceptionally heavy at Reading, where
five friars died out of twenty-six, and at Lynn, where six friars
>died out of thirty-eight.l
