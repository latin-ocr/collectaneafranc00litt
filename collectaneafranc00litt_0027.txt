stance from the corresponding chapters in CelanO. The
writer is not a stylist like Thomas of CelanO. He writes
simply and directly‚ and visualizes very clearly what he
describes, The difference in the versions may be well illus-
trated by comparing No. 1 87 with ΙΙ. Celano, ii. 22. St. Franci5‚
lying sick to death in the bishop’s palace, thought one night
that he could eat a little bread with parsley. Brother Cook is
called in: can he find a little parsley? No; he had picked all
there was; he could hardly find any in the daylight‚ now it
was too dark to see anything, and he could not take a light
because of the wind. Francis begged him several times to go
and try, and at length he went, plucked a handful of weeds
at random-—and among them was found a fine piece of
parsley. The blessed Francis said to his companions: “My
brethren‚ you should not make me say a thing so often''
(Fratres mei, uon debetis me facere dicere rem totiens). In
Celano he speaks much better Latin, and says much more
what a Saint ought to say: “My brethren‚ obey orders at
once, and do not wait for them to be repeated ; and do not
. allege that anything is impossible, for even were I to bid you
do anything beyond your strength, obedience would give you
the strength required '’.

It should be noticed that this chapter is placed between
chapters corresponding to chapters 34 and 35 of Lemmens'
Speculum Perflctionis, and that this is its right place is shown
by the last sentence of Lemmens' chapter 34, where the whole
of our chapter is summarised by these words: “ Dicebat b.
Franciscus ad sociOS, quando sibi statim non obediebant:
Fratres mei, non debetis mihi rem facere”. In Sabatier's
edition ofrthe Speculum Perfectz'om‘s (cap. 47) the story is
represented by a short quotation from CelanO.

Another chapter (189, part 2) throws fresh light on the
story of Silvester's expulsion of the devils from ArezzQ which
happened when St. Francis was on his way to Florence,
intending to go to France, after the Chapter of 1217. Another
of our new chapters (No, 15 5) describes how Francis prepared
for death. This is moving enough in the parallel chapter in
