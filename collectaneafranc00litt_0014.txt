2 BROTHER WILLIAM OF ENGLAND,

him; and making silence and putting aside all chattering, for
the space of half a day they listened to the words of the man
of God without moving, but looking always on the face of the
preacher.'' 1 Matthew Paris makes two additions to this narra-
tive in the margin in connexion with the sketch: the first gives
the words which St. Francis is saying : “ Hail, birds, praise your
creator who feeds you and clothes you with feathers in goodly
array‚ neither do ye toil‚ spin‚ plough or sow, nor gather into
barns’' ; the second runs: “While he was journeying through
the valley of Spoleto this occurred, not only as regards doveS,
crows or daWS‚ but vultures and birds of prey''. Roger of
Wendover's account seems to have been based on hearsay,
Matthew Paris's additionS, either directly or indirectly, on
Celano's Legenda Pr2·ma:2 Celano however gives no support
to Matthew’s “vultureS,” which may either have been an in·-
ference from Roger's “carrion ’' or have been taken from some
verbal report. In the drawing an eagle or vulture is perched
on the top of the tree. The tree, and the ground on which
St. Francis stands, are green 3 the rest uncoloured. It should
be noticed that Francis wears the knotted cord but carries
a pilgrim’s staff.

The second drawing (No. IL), on the lower margin of the
same page, represents the vision of the Seraph and reception
of the stigmata. In Roger of Wendover's text the stigmata
are mentioned : “A fortnight before his death there appeared
wounds in his hands and feet omitting blood continually, as
they had appeared in the Saviour of the world hanging on the
tree when he was crucified by the Jews, His right side ap·

peared so opened and sprinkled with blood that even the inner-
most secrets of the heart seemed visible. . . . After his death

no stigmata of the vaforesaid wounds in side, feet, or handS‚
remained: ”3 but there is no reference to the Seraph. In
