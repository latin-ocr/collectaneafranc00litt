THE LIBRARY OF THE GREY FRIARS OF
HEREFORD.

APPARENTLY the Grey Friars Convent of Hereford was an
early foundation. The Close Rolls of 12 Henry III. (21 Aug,
1228) membrane 3 record a grant by the king in that year
of wood sor the friars to construet a chapel. In 21 Henry ΙΙΙ.
(18 Oct, 1237) he gave them more wood for their church
(Eccleston, ed. Little‚ p. 55, note). In 1246 (Close 30 Hen. III.
m. 8) he granted them permission to buy or accept another
piece of land to enlarge the piece given them by Agnes Byset.1

In the vsame century we have mention of a William

of Leicester, lector at Hereford (Eccleston, p. 62). Adam de
Marisco writing to Frater J.‚ gardianus of Hereford (c. 1250),
praises Walter de Raveningham who seems also to have been
lector there2 (Mon. Fram„ L, 391-392). In 1 293 the Worcester
Annals record the murder ofa lector of the Friars Minor of
Hereford also named Walter (Anglz'a Sacra, I, 515 τ Annales
llffonastz'cz} IV, pp. 51 3-514).

Α “custos ’' of the house mentioned by Eccleston (p. 1 11,
cf. 44) is Fr. Stephanus de Belase (Belassise) ; he was previously
garelianus at Lynn. The twentieth of the Provincials of the
Order in England was “ frater Johannes Went‚ doctor Oxoniae,
qui fecit miracula in vita: jacet Herfordiae'' (Mon. Franc„ I,
pp. 538, 560: Little, Grey Frz‘ars in Oxford, p. 174). William
Herberd or Herebert‚ 4 3rd of the Divinity Readers at Oxford,
was also buried at Hereford (Mon. Frana, I, p. 553). It was
he who owned No, 3 of the extant volumes of the Library‚
and also the Royal MS. 7 F viii. (and probably 7 F vii.): works

1 The house was never a large one: in 1300 it contained thirty-three friars :
Wardrobe Acct„ 29, Edw. 1., Brit. Mus. MS. Add. 7966A., fol. 24b.
2 He was tenth lector of Cambridge: Ecclcston, p. 72.
