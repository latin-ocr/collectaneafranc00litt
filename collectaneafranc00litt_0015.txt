AND SOME FRANCISCAN DRAWINGS 3

Matthew Paris's drawing the Seraph is the dominant figure,
and the Vision is represented as a dream. Francis lies asleep
on the green ground to the right. Above him is the inscrip-
tion: “ St. Francis in the last year but one of his life saw the
Seraphin thus ’'. Above the Seraph is the inscription : “ An-
gelus magni consilii Seraphin''. The Seraph is standing on a
narrow platform‚ stretched on a green cross which is made of
rough tree trunks : the six wingS, two crossed above the head,
two partially spread, two covering the body, are nurnbered in
red (Ala prima, Ala secunda, ete. ). On the right are the names
of the five feathers of each of the six wings (the list of the
feathers of the first wing only are included in the reproduction).1
The wounds in the hands, feet, and side of the Seraph and of
St. Francis are coloured red. The whole conception is clearly
’ inspired by Celano’s Chapter Of the vision of the man having
the lz‘keness of a seraph crucg'fied. “While he dwelt in the
hermitage which . . . is called Alverna, two years before he
gave back his soul to Heaven, he saw in a vision of God a
man like a seraph having six wingS‚ standing over him with
hands outstretched and feet joined together, fixed to a crOSS.
Two wings were raised above his head, two were spread out
for flight, and two veiled the whole body.'' 2 In later pictures
of the event, the Seraph is flying through the air (an incident
inconsistent with CelanO, and first introduced, Ι think, by Bona-
ventura), Francis is awake and kneels on one knee, and lines
or rays join the stigmata of the Seraph to those of Francis,
These two drawings are among the earliest pictorial repre-
sentations of the Preaching to the Birds and the Reception of
the Stigmata nowx in existence. They were made between
1236 and, 1250, and as Matthew Paris's hostility to the friars
increased as time went on, they may perhaps be placed
nearer the earlier than the later date. Had the St. Alban's
draughtsman any earlier drawing before him, or did he draw
them out of his own head, with the assistance of Celano's
legend and the traditional pictures of seraphim? Ican give
