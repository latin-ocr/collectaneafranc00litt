PROVINCE OF EN GLAND 143

The third page (fol. 2³) is in another hand (D). Between
the second and third pages some leaves are missing: these
would probably have contained lists of friars whose deaths
were reported between 8 September, 1 328, and April, Ι 3 34, and
half those whose deaths were reported between April and 8
September, Ι 3 34. For the note at the foot of fol. 2³, “ Isto anno
fuit Capitulum generale apud Assisium,'’ refers to the Whit-
suntide Chapter of 1 3 34. The mention of the death of Friar
Edmund Marshal‚ S.T.P., at Avignon, puts this almost beyond
question, as we know from other sources that he was at Avig-
non in 1333.1 The twenty-nine names in this list are arranged
under custodies but those for the custodies of Eristol‚ Wor-
cester, Newcastle, and the greater part of London are missing,
The names are probably those reported between April and 8
September, 1334.

The fourth page (fol. 2¹³) is the work of two hands (E, F), 2
and the whole of it, except the heading, is crossed out, and
marked νεῖμαί] The heading runs: “Names of friars who
died since the chapter celebrated at Cambridge, 8 Sept.‚
1304 ’'. But here a difficulty arises: in the Close Roll of 32
Edward I. m. 7d. is preserved a royal message of 29 July, 1304,
to “the Friars Minor about to assemble in their chapter general
(sic) at Nottingham’': and on 14 August of the same year
the King gave Α 10 “ for the F riars Minor about to assemble
in provincial chapter at Nottingham on the feast of the
Nativity of the B.V.M.’'³ Has the scribe (E) of our docu-
ment made a mistake‚ and written MCCCIIII. when he
meant to write MCCCXXXIIII. ? We saw reason to believe
that the preceding page recorded the names of those who
died after the Provincial Chapter of 1 3 33, ancl we should
naturally expect this page to contain the names of those who
died after the Chapter of 1334. The handwriting does not
seem to me to be conclusive in favour of either the earlier or

1 See Denifle‚ Chart. Univ. Paris„ ii.‚ 421. He was forty-third master of
the friars at Cambridge (Eccleston‚ p. 73).

‘2 F is more of the trained scribe than any of the others.
