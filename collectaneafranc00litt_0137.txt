GREY FRIARS OF HEREFORD 121

These may have belonged to the Grey FriarS. On the
other hand, a similar but not identical mark, part of which is
the ψ, occurs in P. 1. 7, which Ι take to be a Hereford Cathedral
book on the strength of an entry of price which it, in common
with most of the Cathedral bool<S, contains, I hesitate
therefore to assign the other books to the library in which we
are interested: at the same time it is difficult to believe that
a really searching investigation would not result in bringing
to light a few more F ranciscan volumes, Such an investigation
Ι have not had time to make. I have, however, noted in an
incomplete fashion the provenance of the greater part of the
MSS„ with the result that a large majority of those that can
be traced are original possessions of the Cathedral. Of other
contributors the Abbey of St. Mary, Cirencester‚ is ¹the most
considerable3 then our Grey Friars; then Gloucester Abbey,
and St. Guthlac's Priory at Hereford‚ Wigmore‚ Bury St. Ed-
munds, F laxley, and Dore are responsible for a volume apiece;
and so are certain convents of Grey and Black FriarS, to which
I devote a few more words,
