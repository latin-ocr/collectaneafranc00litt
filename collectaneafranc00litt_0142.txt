126 MANUSCRIPTS OF THE CAMBRIDGE FRIARS

word for Cambridge have been left fairly as in
the MS.; the word “exposita'' has been taken,
following Dr. M. R. James' example, as repre-
senting the various contracted forms used in the
MSS. for the word at the beginning of the
Cautz'oues.

(2) In many cases the MSS. are defective either at the
beginning or at the end, and hence the provenance
has been obscured.

(3) Α numeral preceded by the letter S is the number
of the MS. in the Sirleto collection, under the·
heading Libri theologici, unless otherwise stated.

(4) The letter A shows that the MS. was in the collec-
tion when it belonged to the Duke G. A. AltempS.

(5) †‚ that it was bound in Italy in 1545.

(6) z, that there are many annotations in pencil ; this
practice was a very common one in MSS. which

, belonged to a student's library.
