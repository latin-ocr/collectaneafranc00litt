MANUSCRIPTS OF THE CAMBRIDGE FRIARS 125,

garded as a complete one. It is simplyva hand-list of the>
English MSS. in the Ottoboni collection, published as an
incentive to further investigation. It cannot, however, be
without interest to know exactly what was the material provided
by the friars for the instruction of the inmates and novices of
their Cambridge houses Compared with their sister establish-
ments at Oxford, the Cambridge friaries have been sadly
neglected, and the present study is offered as an inducement
towards their investigation.

Nearly all the MSS. in the accompanying list bear the
mark assigned to them when they formed part of the Library
of Cardinal Sirleto († 1575), and appear in its catalogue, now
MS. Vatican. lat. 6163. They subsequently passed into the
possession of Cardinal Ascanio Colonna, of Duke Giovanni
Angelo di AltempS, and of Cardinal Ottobuoni (Alexander
VIL), before they were purchased for the Vatican Library in
1740 by Benedict XIV.

We can, however, trace some of them back to the original
founder of the collection, Cardinal Marcello Cervini, afterwards
Pope Marcellus IL, whO, on his death in 1555, bequeathed
them to his secretary, Cardinal sirleto. Hehad begun the
collection when quite a young man, “in minoribus,’' and the
fact that eight of the MSS. in the list bear the record of
having been bound in Italy, and presumably in Rome, be-
tween 9 January and 10 February, 1545, shows that they had
crossed the charmel, at latest, within seven years of the suppres—
sion of the smaller English religious houses in Ι 5 38. There is,
however, no evidence as to when or how the MSS. left Cam-
bridge, as to whether they were purchased in England by one
of Marcello Cervini’s buyerS, or whether they were sent to
Rome by the friars for safe custody. It is hoped that M.
Leon Dorez, in some Subsequent notice of the Ottoboni MSS„
may be able to throw some light on this, or that some Cam-
bridge historian may be able to produce the evidence.
