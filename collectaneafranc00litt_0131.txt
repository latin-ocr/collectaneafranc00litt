LIBRARY OF THE GREY FRIARS 115

by him are contained in the Phillipps MS. 8336 (Little‚ Grey
Friars, p. 167 ; Eadm-ton, p. 69, note). This MS. formerly
belonged to Farmer (Fermor) of Tusmore‚ Oxon. “

The 37th English Provincia] was Thomas Radnor, sacrae
theologiae doctor, de custodia Eristolle, et de conventu Here-
fordiae1 (Mon. Franc„ I, 561).

John Ede (Edaeus) was warden at Hereford‚ and died there
in 1406. Various works were attributed to him, and in a
fragmentary copy of one of them in MS. Bodl. Auct. F.
3, 5 (= 2684) is the note: “habetur liber complete inter fratres
minores He[re]fordie'' (Little‚ Grey Friars, p. 254).

In MS. Harl,‚ 431, f. 100b is a note of the election of
J. David as lector at Hereford‚ seemingly before 1416 (Little‚
l.c‚ p, 34, note 3, and 261). Η6 was D.D. of Cambridge and
34th Provincial in 1426. The document relating to his
appointment at Hereford is printed by Little on p. 313.

As to the site and history of the house Leland tells us
something, but very little, in his Itz‘nerary (ed. Toulmin Smith,
II, pp. 66, 67: cf. ed. 1744, iv, p. 83): ‘⁶ Frere Gate standithe
west, caullyd of the Gray Freres house standinge without it . . .
The Grey Friers howse was foundyd by Sir William Penbridge.2
The Bishop of Hereford gave them some landes,

“ There ly beried at the Grey F riers some of the Chaun-
dos3 and Cornwalls. Owen Mereduke, alias Tyder, buried
in the Grey Freyers in navi ecclesiae in sacello sine ulla sepulchri
7726m07f2a.’'

The house was surrendered, and granted in 36 Henry

1He was certainly provincial minister in 1449 and 1458, and probably as
early as 1438 and as late as 1465 : (see p. 132 below).

2The editon of 1744 adds temp Edw I: this is a mistake, as we have seen.
Possibly Sir Richard Pembridge, KG. temp. Edw. III, enj0yed the privileges of
founder. It is perhaps worth noting that in the [ist of English Franciscan houses
in Monumenta Franciscana‚ Ι, p. 580, the Hereford convent has the words ‘⁶ St.
Guthlake’s ” added in brackets, But St. Guthlac’s‚ Hereford, was a Benedictine
priory‚ cell to St. Peter’s Abbey at Gloucester. The mistake appears to have
originated with Speed who confuses the priory with the F ranciscan friary.

3Roger de Chandos granted land to the Friars Preachers of Hereford‚ in
1343: Pat. 17 Ed. III, pt. 1, m. 7.
