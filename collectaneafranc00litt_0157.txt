RECORDS OF THE FRANCISCAN PROVINCE OF
ENGLAND.

(CoTTON CHARTER XXX, 40.)

THE documents here printed, to which my attention was drawn
by Mr. H. J. Ellis of the British Museum, are the only original
records of the English Provincia] Chapters which Ι have yet
discovered. They are preserved in Cotton Charter XXX.‚ 40,
in the British Museum. This consists of a single sheet of
parchment folded so as to make two leaveS, each ¹measuring
9 >< 4} incheS, written on both sides, As the second leaf begins
in the middle of an entry, it is clear that at least one sheet
(two leaves) has dropped out between fol. 1 and fol. 2.

The records contain lists of friars of the province who died
since the last provincial chapter. Such lists had to be sent,
according to the General Constitutions of 1260, to each chapter
general: “ Quo [ie. sermone] completo recitetur numerus
fratrum defunctorum a tempore generalis capituli proximo
preteriti, pro quibus dicatur psalmus De profundis, in fine
Requiem eternam, Pater noster, Et ne nos, A porta inferi, Requi-
escat in pace, Domine exaudi, Dominus vobiscum, oratio Absolve.
Numerus autem fratrum ibidem recitatus ad singulas provincias
deferatur, ut in singulis provincialibus capitulis modo simili
absolvatur.'' 1 The lists here given are probably those drawn
up in the office of the Provincial Minister from information
supplied either at the annual provincial chapter or direct from
the convents or custodies A noticeable feature is the enor-
mous preponderance of priests,

The first page (f. 1³) written in a “Book-hand'' (A) gives
the names of friars who died since the chapter held at Lincoln
1 5 August, Ι 32 7, and contains forty-two names : special markS,
the significance of which Ι do not understand, are prefixed to
