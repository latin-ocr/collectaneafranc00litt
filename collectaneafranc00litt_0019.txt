AND SOME FRANCISCAN DRAWINGS 7

Towards the end of the thirteenth century Brother William
is mentioned by “ Michael Bernardi ” as one of the friars who
told the history of the Indulgence of the Portiuncula.1

The Catalogus sanctorum fratrum minorusz drawn up
about 1 33 5, mentions among the holy friars in the Province
of St. FranciS, “Brother William of England, who after his
death performed many miracleS, but at the command of
Brother Elias then general he ceased to perform miracles
through reverence for the presence of St. Francis’'.‘

The Chronz’cle oftlze XXI V. Generals (p. 2 Ι 7) says z “ Brother

Elias—seeing that Brother William of England, layman, who ,

had been perfect in religion, being buried in the basilica of
St. Francis 3 was coruscating with great miracleS,—moved by
zeal for St. Francis, went to his sepulchre and commanded the
dead man with much confidence and saith not to darken the
glory of the holy Father Francis, From that time he per-
formed no more miracle5.''

The same story is told by Bartholomew of Pisa (Liber de
Confi, ed. Quaracchi, Ι., 193), while it occurs in the Historia
Satyrz'ca4 ancl the Chronologia Alagma ⁵ of Paulinus of Venice,
O.F.M. (who was Bishop of Pozzuoli 1324-1344) and also in
our Phillipps MS. (see below, No, 141) with the curious differ-
ence that the prohibition to work miracles is attributed to
Brother Le0, not to Elias,

The Register of the Grey Friars of London in a list of
bishops and confessors of the Order mentions “The blessed
brother William of England, who was truly obedient, who
obeyed his guardian after his death ’2⁵

3 Mrs. R. Goff, Assisi of St. Francis, p. 214, says: ⁴‘ Behind the altar [of Our
Lady, west transept‚ north-east wall] an iron grille covers the spot where lie
buried five early Franciscans‚ whose portraits adorn the tomb. These are Bernard 01
Quintam-alle, Sylvester, Eletto‚ . . . Valentine‚ . . . and William, an English friar.’'
