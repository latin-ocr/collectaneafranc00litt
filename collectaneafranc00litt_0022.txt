Io DESCRIPTION OF A FRANCISCAN MANUSCRIPT

Laurence of Padua, ST. M, who was ordered by Pope John
XXIII, 15 March, 1412, to hold a provincial chapter of the
Province of St. Anthony for the purpose of electing a provincial
minister in succession to Friar Francis of Belluno ST. M.‚
recently deceased.1 If this identification is correct, Friar
Laurence may have been elected in 1412, or he may have
preceded Francis of Belluno and gone out of office in
accordance with the decree of Innocent VII, 22 November,
1405, which limited the duration of the provincialate to six
years2 As Laurence of Padua was already S.T. M. in 1391,3
the latter is the more probable hypothesis, And this agrees
better with the handwriting of the volume which appears to
date from the first years of the fifteenth century or about 1400.

The contents of the volume, described in detail below, may
be divided into four parts: I. (fols, 1-6 5) the two RuleS, with
papal and other expositions and commentarieS, including those
of Pecham, Bonaventura, the Five Masters and Peter John
Olivi; II. (fols. 65-104)‚ the Actu53 4 III. (fols. 104-141)‚
chapters from the Speculum perfectionis and other collections;
IV. (fols. 142-153)‚ another version of the Actus3 V. miscell-
aneous

The mos-t interesting parts are II. and III.

II. When Sabatier published his edition of the Actus Beati
Francz'scz‘ et sociorum ejus in 1902, he was unable to find in any
manuscript of the Actus the Latin versions of six chapters of
the Fz'orettc', namely Chapters 3 7 (on the courtesy of the rich
knight), 38 (on Brother Elias), 41 (on Brother Simon of Assisi), »
44 (the vision of Brother Conrad)‚ 46 (Brother Humble and
Brother Peaceful), 48 (the dream of Brother Jacques de Massa).
Of the last five of these chapters he found and printed in an
Appendix more or less inadequate Latin versionS, taken from
Bartholomew of Pisa, the Chronicle of the twenty-four Generals
and the Speculum Vitae. But Chapter 37 was represented

1 Ruti. Franc. vii, No. 1253.

2Ibz'd. No. 507. 3Ibid. No. 80.

4 The quires of the MS. which the scribe was copying had evidently been
misplaced. He begins with Chapters 24, 25, 26, 27, etc„ and inserts Chapters 1-23
at the end, drawing attention to his mistake on fol. 104r.
