DESCRIPTION OF A FRANCISCAN MANUSCRIPT
FORMERLY IN THE PHILLIPPS LIBRARY NOW
IN THE POSSESSION OF A. G. LITTLE.1

THE volume described in the following pages was purchased
by me at a sale of a portion of the library of the late Sir
Thomas Phillipps in 1910. It was bought by him in 1848
from Payne and Foss, bookselleffi, with a number of other
MSS. (Nos. 12260-12313) 2 which are described in the printed
Catalogue of the Bibliotheca Phillippica as ex Abb. S. Stephani
de Nova Fossa. There is no indication in the manuscript
itself that the volume now under consideration came from the
· Abbey of Fossa N uova.

The MS. was written, as an inscription on fol. 204r state5‚
by order of “Friar Laurence of Rieti‚ minister in the
Province of St. Anthony” (or Venice).3 'Of Friar Laurence
a short notice is given in Sbaralea's Supplementum ad
Scriptores Ordines [Wz'norum .· “Laurentius ReatinUS, ST. Mag.
