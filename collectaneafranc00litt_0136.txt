120 THE LIBRARY OF THE

18 . . . Brit. Mus, Cotton Nero A IX. ff. 25 to end, or per-
haps only ff. 75-104 (see Little, Ecclest0n‚ p. xi).
Chronicle to 1278, and documents relating to the
F ranciscan Order. On f. 103 is ‘liber de conuentu
herford‚' but there is no press-rnark.1

Mr. J. P. Gilson adds in alletter to me: “As Royal 7 F
viii. certainly, and 7 F vii. probably, belonged to William
Herebert, the Hereford Franciscans may probably lay claim
to them also,2 It would be worth while to look in Roger
Bacon’s MSS. (of English origin and compatible date) for traces
of Herebert's hand.’'

7 F vii. and viii. both contain works of Roger Bacon. They
were among the MSS. of Theyer of Coopershill, bought for the
Library under Charles ΙΙ.

Α further question is raised by the occurrence of the letter
«pk in No, 9. I find them also in the following books at
Hereford:

O. 3. 8. Works ofChrysostom in Latin. Cent. xiii. The top
of the fly-leas is gone ς but «pk. 9. remainS‚ and there
is a list of contents of Cent. xv. late signed ‘quod
herford ’. In the last cover is an erasure, and there
is a fine sketch of a piece of ornament, and a
column of interesting verses, including a single line
headed

Sigillum Walteri Map.
Munera si uitas transcendes archileuitaS.

O. 3. 9. Homiliae Gregorii, ete. Cent. xiv. Marked qu.

O. 3. 12. Petri Lombardi Sententiae. Cent. xiv. Marked

¹ wlrk in the cover.

1 The MS. fragment of Eccleston formerly at Lamport Hall and now lost
formed part of this MS. ; Little, Eccleston, p. 10.

2R0ya1 7 F viii. contains the following erased inscriptions which were
treated with a reagent and photographed : f. 13; “ Iste liber est de ordine fratrum
minorum concessus fratri Willelmo Herebert qui eum ad ordinem procuravit.
Qui ejus usum habuerit oret pro anima dicti fratris'’; f. 47: ·‘ Iste liber est de
ordine fratrum minorum concessus fratri Willelmo Herbert ad usum quem librum
ipse pro ordine procuravit. Qui ejus usum habuerit oret pro anima dicti fratris.
Hunc librum . . . Minorum H[erefordie]. . . .’' Mr. Steele took photographs
of the inscriptions and kindly lent them tor this note.
