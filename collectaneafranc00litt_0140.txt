A SHORT NOTICE OF SOME MANUSCRIPTS OF
THE CAMBRIDGE FRIARS, NOW IN THE
VATICAN LIBRARY.

SOME years ag0‚ when looking through the Ottoboni collec-
tion in the Vatican Library, I was struck by the presence in it
of many MSS. of English writing‚ several of which had clear
indications that they had belonged to the libraries of the Grey
Friars and the Black Friars of Cambridge. I have in vain
attempted to induce two Cambridge scholars to investigate
these MSS, and it is only at the repeated request of the Editor
of this series that I have done so myself; the subject is
entirely outside my usual course of research, and the limited
number of reference books on English history in the Vatican
Library prevents anything like a serious investigation of the
names ofEnglishmen who appear either as owners or as borrow-
ers of these MSS. The identifying of these names is therefore
left to some future scholar who will follow up the present
sketch, and his work must be done in England and not in
Rome. The Editor has kindly provided the footnote5‚ and
Dr. 'Pelzer of the Vatican Library has given much valuablev
help as to the MSS.

Almost without exception the MSS. represent scholastic
philosophy and theology‚ and can, roughly, be assigned to the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries: no attempt has here been
made to give their dateS, the purpose of this article being
to record their provenance, and not their age.

Nor is it pretended that all the Ottoboni MSS.‚ which
number more than 3,ooo, have been examined; the classical
author5‚ and all paper MSS. have been disregarded as not
likely to fall within the present purview3 it is quite possible
that some have been omitted which might have provided

· material for the present study ; hence the list must not be re-
