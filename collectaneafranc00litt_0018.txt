6 BROTHER WILLIAM OF ENGLAND,

garment falling from the left arm is an afterthought and
interferes with the candle, which the artist has tried to rub
out ; the keys have been altered from one shape to another ;
above the thumb and two raised fingers of the right'hand are
traces of stars ; and under the four candlesticks, partly hidden
by the inscription about Marcella, may be detected the out-
line of a small kneeling figure with joined hands raised in
prayer—representing perhaps the artist himself.1

’ Of Brother William little is known, and no reference to
his artistic genius seems to occur in any of the legends or
chronicles of the Order.

A “Frater Wilhelmus AnglicUS,'' who may very likely be
our friar, was one of the ten brethren sent with John de Piano
de Carpine to found the custody of Saxony in 1223 :2 he had
perhaps accompanied the new minister, Albert of Pisa, to
Germany from Italy earlier in the year. Apart from this the
earliest mention of Brother William yet discovered in Fran-
ciscan literature occurs in the Liber de Laudffim, written about
1280 by Bernard de Bessa, secretary of St. Bonaventura.
Bernard tells how a Spanish Cistercian named Gonsalv0‚ after-
wards called Anthony,·“ saw in a vision St. Francis and with
him another holy friar William, whose bones made famous by
miracles rest in the church of St. F rancis.. He saw also a
very fair bed which Brother William on being asked said
was the bed of St. Francis, ‘And 1,' said Anthony‚ ‘wish
to lie in it, that I may be able to say that I have lain in so
fair a bed.' After this vision, when the monks wanted to
make him abbot, he entered the Order of Friars Minor, or, as
it were, the bed of St. F ranci5.” 3 ι

This passage is inserted in the Chronz'cle of the XXIV
Generals, with the additions that the monk is called a native
of Segovia, and the friar, William of England.4

A. Herbert, who, however, is not to be held responsible for any of my conclusions.
