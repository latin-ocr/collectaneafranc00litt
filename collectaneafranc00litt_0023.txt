FORMERLY IN THE PHILLIPPS LIBRARY 11

only by a few words found in Bartholomew of Pisa, who quoted
from the Legenda Antiqua the well-known passage on courtesy.l
“Know, dear brother, that courtesy is one of the attributes of
God‚ who courteously giveth his sun and his rain and all things
to the just and the unjust: and courtesy is the sister of charity,
and quencheth hate and feedeth love.'’

In reviewing Sabatier's edition of the Actus, Father van
Ortroy asserted that the Latin version of Chapter 37 of the
Fz‘orettz' was to be found in a manuscript in the University
Library at Utrecht (Kast 4, Plut. C, N o, 2).2 This is a mistake
as Father Jose‘ Maria de Elizondo has pointed out.3 F ather
de Elizondo has recently discovered in a private library at
Barcelona a MS. of the Actus containing five0 of the missing ,
chapters,4 though apparently in a somewhat abbreviated form

Our manuscript contains all the six missing chapters.5 Five
are now printed for the first time, namely chapters 46 (fol. 81V)‚
41 (fol. 821), 37 (fol. 861), 38 (fol. 86v)‚ 44 (fol. 87f). Chapter
48 (fol. 87⁹) is identical save for unimportant variantS, with
a passage in the Historia T rz'bulatz‘onum of Angelo of ClarenO.6
The Latin of the other five chapters corresponds substantially
with the Italian of the Fz'orettz' except that there is an interesting
addition to Chapter 41. “And Brother Ugolino of the Mount
of St. Mary was at Brunforte for three years and had certain
ocular proof of this miracle (z'.e., banishment of crows by
Brother Simon of Assisi) which was known to both seculars
and F riars of the whole custody.'' ⁷ The same passage,
F ather de Elizondo informs me, occurs in the Barcelona
manuscript. ⁷ .

The text of the Actus preserved in the Phillipps MS. fol. 65-
104 bears generally speaking a closer resemblance than any
of the MSS. used by Sabatier to the text of the Fiorettz‘.
Many similarities are indicated in the textual notes, In many
points it agrees with the readings of MS. Liege 343, with
