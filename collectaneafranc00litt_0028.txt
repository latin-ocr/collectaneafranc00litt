16 DESCRIPTION OF A FRANCISCAN MANUSCRIPT

Celano (ii. 162): it is far more moving in the plain and un-
adorned language of the writer whom Sabatier has taught us
to identify with Brother Leo of Assisi, pecorella Dei.

It is generally admitted that the Second Legend of Celano
is based mainly on materials supplied by the companions of
the Saint ; that it is in fact a revised and more or less expur-
gated edition of the original Legend of the “Three Com-
panions''. In so far as we can get behind Celano to the
materials which he used, we get to the writings of the com-
panionS, chief among whom is Brother Leo, Much of these
writings is found in the Speculum Peafectz'omk, and the Phillipps
MS. enables us to make an important addition to them.

The group of Mz'racula (Nos, 170-8, 181-3) includes
eight miracles contained in Celano’s T ructatus de Mz'raculz's in
a somewhat different form, one from Bonaventura (or the Ac-
tus iu Valle¹ Reatina), and three not found elsewhere, but of
no particular interest. What the exact relation of the eight
miracles here given is to the corresponding miracles in CelanO,
it is difficult to say. One would be inclined to conclude from
a comparison of No. 171 with Celano 88 that the former was
the original, and that Celano in condensing the narrative had
misstated some of the facts. But it is hard to believe that
Celano would have sacrificed such plays upon words as arte
artiori (No. 170) and prece vel pretio (No. Ι 71) if he had found
them in his original. It is possible that these Chapters repre-
sent a revised edition, perhaps by Celano himself. Attention
may be called to one other miraculum (No. 204) which is in-
serted after the group of testimonies on the Indulgence. The
mention by name of the podestat and his officers will interest
students of the history of Assisi.

(d) The last subdivision seems to begin with the testi-
monies on the Indugence of the Portiuncula. The first of
these (No. 200) has a larger initial than usual.

V. In the fifth part of the volume, that namely which
follows the second version of the Actus, the most interesting
item is perhaps the life of the Blessed Roger of Provence. It
