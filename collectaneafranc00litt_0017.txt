AND SOME FRANCISCAN DRAWINGS 5

On the verso of the leaf are some miscellaneous notes (a
prayer of Stg Edmund,1 a note about a holy woman named
Marcella)‚2 followed by this injunction: “Nothing more is to
be written on this page lest the image (of Christ) be injured,
as the parchment is transparent, and it can be seen better if
held up to the light '’ (si opponatur lucz). Lower down is a
drawing, in the St. Albans style, of a small male figure partly
nude, seated : no explanation is given of it.

The question arises whether this drawing is the original
work of Brother William or a copy by a St. Albans artist?
Unfortunately the volume is so tightly bound that Ι have en-
tirely failed to make out its structure. Is fol. 155 an inserted
leaf, or is it part of a quire? The vellum appears to be of
exactly the same thickness and quality as the vellum of the
succeeding' leaves On the other hand, there is some evidence
that this leaf was originally larger than most of the leaves of
which the book is composed, and has suffered more at the
hands of the binder. The direction on the verso of the leaf
about holding it up to light suggests a loose sheet. That
documents coming from elsewhere were sometimes inserted in
the volume and not copied into it appears from the fact
that some of the documents in the Liber Addz'tamentorum
are not in any of the St. Albans hands, Again, the draw-
ing of this figure differs from all the others which I have
examined in Matthew Paris‘s MSS. : the lines are more delicate,
the folds of the garment more graceful, the hands more finely
shaped3 there is more than a suggestion of Italian influence.
If it is a copy made at St. Albans, it is safe to say that the
artist who copied it reproduced the original faithfully and
preserved-the style of Brother William. More conclusive
evidence, however, that the sketch is the original and not a
copy is afforded by the numerous corrections and alterations
init. Both feet have been re-drawn ; the outer fold of the

Canterbury, p. 586), is followed by the note ; “ Reuerte hoc folium et sequitur

preceding or succeeding pages.
